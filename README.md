# Assignment02: Pilot Usability Test
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Introduction
PC Part Picker is a website that assists PC builders with choosing their parts, tracking their parts, testing if their parts are compatible. It functions as an online catalog but also a "social media" platform of sorts, where PC fans can share pictures of their builds. After conducting a Heuristic Evaluation on the website, a few usability issues emerged. While the website itself is extremely helpful, the way it presents its features is not optimal. In particular, it is difficult for first time PC builders to understand, especially with its technical jargon. The site also throws dozens of products/components at the user, who may or may not be familiar with what each product does. 

This pilot UT seeks to test if a first time PC builder can navigate the site and its various functions. Each task was designed with a specific goal in mind. The first task tests if the user can easily locate a component when building a PC. The second tests the social media aspect of the site, testing the discoverability of relevant builds. The last task then evaluates a more niche function of the site, which is locating good deals on parts. Together, I hope these test help gain a better insight into the user experience of an inexperienced builder.
